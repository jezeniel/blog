Hey there! I'm Jezeniel, a passionate software engineer with 10+ years of development experience.

My interests are AI, web development, software architecture/design, game development.

I work across the entire stack—Python (Django, Flask), Node.js, Ruby, and Go on the backend, 
React and Vue on the frontend, plus everything in between: APIs, databases, Cloud infrastructure 
(AWS, GCP), and CI/CD pipelines. 

Experience in building from scratch, from initial planning all the way to production. 
As well as improving and scaling existing systems. I've architected 
scalable systems, led engineering teams, and mentored developers, but I'm just as comfortable 
diving deep into code.

I love solving problems and making things work better. I'm not satisfied with just getting things 
done—I want to understand the why and build solutions that actually add value.

I also contribute to some open source projects that I use as much as I can.

I live in the Philippines together with my wife and daughter.
